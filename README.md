# Forge Browser

`browser.fg` is the Forge DOM/events/navigation/HTTP/storage API. `src/bridge.js`
provides browser primitives and lossless JSON handles for `web.fg`. Forge's
`--emit-js` target generates application logic; this module does not embed
application routes, database policy or UI copy.

Bundle the bridge with esbuild and load it before the emitted JavaScript. JSON
handles are local to a synchronous callback; DOM handles persist until their
subtree is cleared. Never retain JSON handles across callbacks. Async HTTP
callbacks receive `{context,status,data,error}`. Applications reject stale
responses using their own route context. HTTP requests and authenticated uploads
are restricted to `/api/` on the current origin. Markdown is sanitized with
DOMPurify; HTML/event attributes and dangerous URL schemes are rejected.

Requires the Forge JavaScript backend, browser BigInt/TextEncoder support, and
Node for bundling. Native C builds cannot use this browser-only module. See
portfolio-platform/frontend-forge for a complete integration.

Module version 0.1.4 pins Forge Web 0.1.3, matching its current protocol and JSON
bridge API. Version 0.1.3 remains immutable and retains its Web 0.1.2 dependency.
Use the matching exact versions in your package manifest and lock file.
